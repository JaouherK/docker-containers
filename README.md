Docker Containers By Me
=======================

This repository contains various branches, each with a different
[docker](https://www.docker.com/) container image.  These are generally for my own
personal development or professional needs, and none of these should be considered
stable and maintained.

If you end up liking and depending on one of these containers, I recommend forking
and building your own image, so that if I delete the container image you're using
you will have a copy and can use it without interuption.  You have been warned.
