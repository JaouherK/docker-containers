# stevepacker/caddy-php71-xdebug

This container is intended to run tests (including unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests) for applications run on the `stevepacker/caddy-php71` docker image.  This container uses that as a base, and adds the `xdebug` PHP extension as well as the `chromium-chromedriver` package to run a headless Chrome browser.
