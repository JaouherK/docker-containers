Includes all the plugins listed on:

!! Use at your own risk !!
(The Caddy website says "Only choose plugins you trust", and since this container contains ALL the plugins, you need a lot of trust to use it)

Javascript console wizardry includes running:
$("label.plugin :checkbox[data-name]").attr("checked", false).click();
console.log($("#direct-link").val().split('plugins=')[1])

The output then goes into the Dockerfile ARG
